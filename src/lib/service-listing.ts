 * (`src/lib/listingPrice.ts`, `priceBreakdown.ts`, `multiDay.ts` and
 * `formatDuration` in the /m page's getMerchant.ts). The merchant portal now
 * previews the same card while the pro types the price, so those words moved
 * here unchanged and both apps call them: the card the merchant approves is
 * the card a customer sees.
 *
 * NO MONEY ARITHMETIC (AUTM-1302). Every figure is one the server returned:
 * customer-api's `priceBreakdown` on the profile, merchant-api's
 * `previewCustomerPrices` in the portal, both from the same fee engine. This
 * file picks and formats. The fee is never printed as a rate: under the
 * minimum a $10 service pays a fee that is not the rate times its price
 * (AUTM-1512).
 *
 * In its own module, without 'use client', so a server component can call it.
