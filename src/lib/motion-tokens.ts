/**
 * The `--motion-*` tokens from `utilities/animations.css`, as typed values
 * for motion driven from JavaScript (framer-motion, `motion/react`, the Web
 * Animations API). AUTM-1594.
 *
 * Why: merchant-web read these off the page with `getComputedStyle` and kept
 * a hard-coded fallback for the server render (its `src/utils/motion.ts`,
 * AUTM-1601). A copy like that drifts the day a token moves. These are the
 * same numbers, shipped with the stylesheet that defines them, and
 * `motion-tokens.test.ts` fails if the two ever disagree.
 *
 * Pairing, as the stylesheet does it: an EXIT (`*Out`) runs on the ease-in
 * curve and everything else (every enter, and hover and press) on ease-out. Enters are slower than
 * exits on purpose: an opening surface is asking for attention and a closing
 * one is getting out of the way. `motionTransition()` applies the pairing.
 *
 *     import { motionTransition } from '@autara-au/autara-ui'
 *     <motion.div
 *         initial={{ y: '100%' }}
 *         animate={{ y: 0, transition: motionTransition('sheetIn') }}
 *         exit={{ y: '100%', transition: motionTransition('sheetOut') }}
 *     />
 *
 * Reduced motion: the stylesheet clamps every CSS animation for a user who
 * asked for less motion, and that clamp cannot reach an animation driven from
 * JS. Honour it where the animation is defined, for framer-motion with
 * `<MotionConfig reducedMotion="user">` or `useReducedMotion()`. Animate
 * `transform` and `opacity` only, as the CSS does.
