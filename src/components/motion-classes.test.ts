/**
 * AUTM-967 — A CLASS THAT EMITS NOTHING IS WORSE THAN NO CLASS, because it
 * reads as done.
 *
 * Seven components styled their enter and exit with `animate-in`,
 * `fade-in-0`, `zoom-in-95` and `slide-in-from-*`. Those are
 * `tailwindcss-animate` utilities. The plugin is not a dependency of this
 * package, and it is not a dependency of merchant-mobile, merchant-web or
 * customer-web either — Tailwind generates utilities from the CONSUMER's
 * config, so even installing it here would not have been enough.
 *
 * The result: every dialog, sheet, tooltip, dropdown, select, phone-input
 * country list and nav menu across all three web surfaces appeared and
 * disappeared on the frame it was asked for. Nothing errored. Nothing warned.
 * The source read as though the animation was handled, which is the entire
 * reason it survived from the first Radix wrapper until now.
 *
 * This file makes that failure loud in three ways, and the third is the one
 * that generalises:
 *
 *   1. No component reaches for a plugin utility again.
 *   2. The plugin stays out of `package.json` — adding it would make the old
 *      classes resolve HERE and still not in a consumer, which is a worse
 *      state than today because it would look fixed in Storybook.
 *   3. Every animation a stylesheet names has keyframes that exist. A typo'd
 *      keyframe name is silent in exactly the same way, and that is the shape
 *      of the bug rather than the specific classes involved.
 *
 * A source scan, like its neighbours in this directory, because jsdom has no
 * stylesheet: a render assertion would pass while the real app was still
 * snapping. The behaviour itself is verified in a browser — see the AUTM-967
 * PR for `getComputedStyle(...).animationName` on each surface.
