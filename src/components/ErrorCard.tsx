/**
 * ErrorCard — the "we couldn't load this, here's why, try again" surface.
 *
 * Use on every async surface that can fail. Pair with `AsyncSkeleton`
 * (loading) and `EmptyState` (empty) to satisfy the workspace cross-stack
 * rule: every async surface honors success / loading / error / empty.
 *
 * AUTM-936 — this was built out of raw Tailwind `rose-*` / `amber-*`,
 * which are static values on a themed canvas. On the dark canvas the
 * tinted fill composited to a muddy grey and the title landed at 1.82:1,
 * while the retry button (`bg-white text-rose-900`) punched a white slab
 * into a dark page. merchant-mobile renders this inside AppErrorBoundary,
 * so the app-wide crash screen was the surface that failed — the worst
 * possible place for the copy to be unreadable, because the retry control
 * is the only way out.
 *
 * The rebuild followed the house grammar rather than re-tinting. AUTM-1594
 * moved it to canvas v44's band card (see the render below): no intent disc
 * and no hairline, the words and the ink Retry carry it. Every value is a
 * token, so both themes track the ladder.
 *
 * Copy guidance — recoverable + specific:
 *   - Bad: "Something went wrong" (Autara house rule: don't ship this)
 *   - Good: "We couldn't load your bookings — check your connection and
 *     tap retry."
 *
 * Tone:
 *   - `error` (default) — real failure, action expected.
 *   - `warning` — soft failure, may recover on its own.
