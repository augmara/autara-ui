/**
 * PWAInstallBanner — bottom-anchored "Add to home screen" affordance.
 *
 * Two paths:
 *   - Chrome / Android: listens for `beforeinstallprompt`, stashes the
 *     event, and on tap calls `event.prompt()`.
 *   - iOS Safari (no `beforeinstallprompt`): renders manual
 *     instructions ("Tap Share → Add to Home Screen").
 *
 * Anti-nag rules:
 *   - skip if already installed (display-mode: standalone)
 *   - skip if dismissed within `dismissTtlMs` (default 30 days)
 *   - wait `firstShowDelayMs` (default 12s) before surfacing
 *
 * Copy is parameterised so every Autara app can mount the same
 * banner. The "Add to home screen" eyebrow stays for consistency.
 *
 * Promoted from autara-customer-web 2026-05-30 (AUTAA-UI-007). The
 * customer-web original was Iconify-coupled; this version inlines the
 * Solar-style glyphs as SVGs (no icon dependency).
 *
 * ─── AUTM-1018: the role, the space, and the layer ──────────────────────
 *
 * This shipped carrying the SAME defects AUTM-852 had just fixed on
 * `ConsentBanner`, because the two were written months apart from the same
 * bad starting point rather than from each other. All four were verified in
 * this file before being changed, not taken from the report.
 *
 * ROLE. It claimed `role="dialog"` while being non-modal: it never moved
 * focus into itself, never trapped focus, had no Escape handler and restored
 * nothing on close. The role promises a window that has taken over and this
 * is a banner that has not — and stealing focus on first paint to nag about a
 * home-screen shortcut would be worse than the inaccuracy, so the answer is
 * the role, not the behaviour. It also made `getByRole("dialog")` ambiguous
 * the moment a real `Dialog` was on screen, which is exactly the page where
 * the overlap bugs live and exactly how the sibling defect stayed hidden.
 * `region` with a REQUIRED accessible name is the same answer `ConsentBanner`
 * landed on, for the same reasons, and reaches a screen reader's landmark
 * list. `alertdialog` (modal, and nothing here is urgent), `complementary`
 * (a landmark for content complementing the main content — an install nag is
 * not that) and `alert` / `aria-live` (interrupts) were rejected there and
 * are rejected here.
 *
 * SPACE. It was `fixed bottom-0` and reserved nothing, so it covered whatever
 * sat at the bottom of the page — the AUTM-787 / -845 / -839 defect, on a
 * banner that appears UNANNOUNCED 12 seconds in, which is worse than the
 * consent notice: the page was usable and then quietly was not. It now uses
 * the shared reservation in `../lib/reserved-bottom-space`, so scrolling
 * content gets body padding and fixed page chrome gets a measured custom
 * property. Same mechanism, same naming convention, one implementation.
 *
 * LAYER. It sat at `z-[55]`, ABOVE the library's `Dialog` and `Sheet` at
 * `z-50` — the AUTM-1000 bug with the ordering inverted, and reachable by
 * nothing more than leaving a page open for twelve seconds with a dialog
 * open. It is now `z-30`: under the modal layer, and one step under
 * `ConsentBanner` at `z-40` as well, because consent is a legal gate and an
 * install nag is the least important thing on the page. That ladder is
 * content < install banner (30) < consent (40) < Dialog / Sheet (50) <
 * `GradientBar` (60) < `Toast` (100).
 *
 * The two banners are also separated GEOMETRICALLY, not just by z: this one
 * sits on top of the consent notice via `CONSENT_BANNER_OFFSET`, dropping to
 * the viewport edge whenever no consent banner is up. Without that they
 * overlap on a phone and the reservation would claim space for two banners
 * while one was buried under the other.
 *
 * PORTAL. `position: fixed` resolves against the nearest ancestor with a
 * transform, a filter, a `backdrop-filter` or containment — not the viewport
 * (AUTM-721). Rendering inline meant any consumer that mounted this inside a
 * glass or animated wrapper got a banner anchored to that wrapper. It
 * portals to `document.body`, which also puts it behind Radix's modal
 * `aria-hidden` as a sibling rather than beside it.
