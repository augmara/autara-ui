/**
 * Logo — Autara primary wordmark + orb mark, inlined SVG.
 *
 * Source: the primary `autara` brand wordmark with the radiating
 * orb mark on the left. Inlined as a React component so consumers
 * can:
 *   - Theme the wordmark via `currentColor` (set the surrounding
 *     text color and the letters follow)
 *   - Size via Tailwind utility classes (no layout shift from image
 *     load)
 *   - Avoid a per-asset HTTP round-trip on cold launch
 *
 * The orb gradient (purple → aqua) stays brand-locked regardless of
 * surrounding text color — the wordmark is the only themable part.
 *
 * Default size is `h-7 w-auto` (~28 px tall). Override via className.
 * Pass `textOnly` to omit the orb (useful in narrow detail-screen
 * chrome).
 *
 * ── `lockup="business"` (AUTM-1158) ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Merchant and customer are two products wearing one wordmark. A merchant
 * signing in to run their business saw exactly what a customer sees booking
 * a wash, which is a real identity problem and not a decorative one.
 *
 * The shape is concept E from the 2026-09-07 lockup sheet, chosen by Don out
 * of six: mark and wordmark as they ship, a vertical hairline, then the
 * descriptor. The stacked variants read better at hero size but lose the
 * descriptor first when vertical room is tight, and every surface this
 * appears on is an app bar or a card header.
 *
 * The hairline is a SEPARATOR, not emphasis, so it is not the outline
 * direction rule 4 bans — it is the same family as the hairline that defines
 * a glass edge. Without it the two halves read as unrelated objects placed
 * near each other, which was the first cut and what Don rejected.
 *
 * `size` rather than a free className for the descriptor, because it has to
 * scale WITH the mark and CSS cannot derive a font-size from an SVG's height
 * (`em` resolves against inherited font-size, not the box). Two independent
 * knobs drift apart; these are set together.
 *
 * The descriptor is NEVER hidden at a breakpoint. Both consumers had
 * hand-composed this with `hidden sm:inline`, so on a phone — merchant
 * mobile's primary form factor — the distinction vanished exactly where the
 * two products are easiest to confuse.
