/**
 * Progress — a determinate bar: a track plus a filled indicator.
 *
 * AUTM-975 — `theme` defaulted to `'dark'`, and the dark branch paints the
 * track `bg-white/[0.1]`. On the cream canvas that is 10% white over
 * near-white: the track disappeared entirely and the bar read as a floating
 * purple stub with no "out of what". The default is now `'light'`, which is
 * the branch built from semantic tokens and therefore the one that tracks the
 * theme in both directions; `'dark'` remains the static ink opt-in for a
 * photo or marketing surface.
 *
 * The prop's value names are published API and are kept as they are — see the
 * same note on `Table` and `Avatar`, which had the identical parameter-default
 * shape and are guarded together by `default-variant.test.ts`.
 *
 * Known and NOT fixed here: `--surface-elevated` is only ~1.06:1 from
 * `--surface` in light, so the track is faint on a white card even after the
 * flip. That is a token-ladder question, not a default-selection one.
