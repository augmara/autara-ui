/**
 * FilterChipRow — single-select pill row used as the secondary
 * filter on filtered-list screens (booking status, inbox filter,
 * service status, notification tab).
 *
 * AUTM-1594 — canvas v44 "Filter chips": pills, 13px Medium. The active chip
 * is the selected colour (#2e1070, #8f6bff in dark) with its own ink; the
 * rest are band with ink. The row scrolls horizontally on narrow surfaces.
 * Drawn at the sheet's 36px with AUTM-622's 44px floor kept as a hit area
 * (the unpainted pseudo-element Switch and Tabs use). The row scrolls, and a
 * scroller clips what pokes out of it, so the row carries 4px of vertical
 * padding: that is where the extra 8px of target lives.
 *
 * ─── AUTM-974: the inactive chip lost its border ────────────────────────
 *
 * The active chip was already solid; the inactive ones were
 * `border border-[var(--border-subtle)]` on `--surface`, i.e. outlined boxes
 * sitting next to a solid one. Rule 4 of the Autara Glass direction bans
 * outlines outright, and there was a second reason to go: a row of five
 * hairline rectangles is five rectangles competing with the one chip that is
 * meant to stand out. Emphasis reads better when the unemphasised things stop
 * drawing themselves.
 *
 * The focus ring moved with it. `ring-[var(--color-autara-purple)]/35` with no
 * offset drew a translucent purple line directly against the ink capsule —
 * 1.8:1, under the 3:1 WCAG 2.4.11 asks of a focus indicator. It is now
 * full-strength `--accent` with a 2px offset band in the page canvas.
 *
 * Why a single component vs leaving each consumer to roll its own:
 *   - The previous inline pattern was duplicated 4× across
 *     merchant-mobile screens with slightly different paddings and
 *     transitions — drift waiting to happen.
 *   - The "ink active + outline inactive" pair is a canonical
 *     Autara editorial pattern; consolidate so future tweaks land
 *     in one place.
 *
 * Type parameter `V` lets the consumer keep their own value union
 * (string / null / enum) without casting at the callsite.

                               first pass at that ticket, which fixed `Switch` and
                               `Tabs` and shipped in 5.3.1 while the ticket also
                               names this component. A board audit caught it: the
                               chips were still `px-3 py-1.5` with no minimum and
                               rendered at 32px, so anyone closing AUTM-622 on
                               5.3.1 would have closed it over a live defect.

                               A MINIMUM in rem, not a fixed height, for the same
                               reason Tabs uses one: at 200% text scale the label
                               is taller than 44px and the control has to grow
                               with it rather than clip. */
