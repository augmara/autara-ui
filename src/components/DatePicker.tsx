 * that left behind was a rail holding 806px of days in a 400px box with no
 * scrollbar and no arrows, so half the fortnight was unreachable with a mouse
 * and nothing on screen said those days existed. QA measured 7 of 14 days
 * visible, and before the sheet was pinned the only way to reach day 8 was to
 * drag the whole sheet sideways, which was itself the other half of that bug.
 *
 * Shown only where the pointer is FINE. A touch device scrolls the rail by
 * dragging it and always could, so arrows there would spend two day-widths of
 * a phone's rail on a problem it does not have. An iPad with a trackpad
 * reports a fine pointer and gets them, which is the case that matters most.
 *
 * Deliberately `aria-hidden` and out of the tab order. The rail is a
 * radiogroup with ONE tab stop and arrow keys inside it, which is already a
 * better keyboard route than two buttons; exposing these would add two tab
 * stops to a control built to have one, and would read to a screen reader as a
 * second way to do what the arrow keys already do. Nothing becomes
 * mouse-only: every day is still a radio in the group.

/**
 * DatePicker — a rail of the coming days, with the full month one tap behind it.
 *
 * ── AUTM-1633: any date, and the rail follows ────────────────────────────
 *
 * Don, 2026-10-03: "dates are very limited but I like the UI". The month was
 * already behind the rail, behind a ghost "More dates" link that read as a
 * footnote. It is now a "Pick a date" button with a calendar icon, and it
 * opens `MonthCalendar` as the library's responsive dialog: a bottom sheet on
 * a phone, a centred card from `sm`. Choosing a day there that the rail does
 * not hold MOVES the rail to it (three days before it, see `RAIL_LEAD`) and
 * scrolls it into view selected, so the merchant sees their choice where they
 * left off rather than a fortnight that no longer contains it.
 *
 * ── Why a rail and not a calendar ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The moment this serves is a merchant taking a walk-in or a phone booking
 * with the customer waiting. Those jobs are nearly always inside a fortnight,
 * so the rail answers the common case in ONE tap where a calendar costs an
 * open, a read and a tap. Fresha and Booksy both landed on the same shape for
 * the same reason. The month sheet is still there for the job in November.
 *
 * ── What it refuses to do ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It never reads the clock. `today` comes in from the caller in the shop's
 * timezone. See `lib/calendar.ts` for why that is the whole point.
 *
 * It never renders a date the merchant cannot pick as though they could: out
 * of range and `unavailable` days are `aria-disabled` and inert, rather than
 * accepting the tap and failing later in the form.
