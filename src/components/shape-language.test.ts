/**
 * AUTM-1594 — canvas v44's component sheet, approved by Don for Autara Web,
 * supersedes the rule below for BUTTONS: "Pills, 44px minimum". A button is a
 * pill again (radius half its height, in rem, so a wrapped label at 200% text
 * gives a rounded rectangle rather than a capsule), and the icon-only action
 * is a 44px disc. Fields keep 14px; the surfaces' ladder moves with their own
 * family. The rest of this file still guards everything the sheet has not
 * reached yet, and each family that lands updates its part here.
 *
 * THE SHAPE LANGUAGE — Don, 2026-09-01. Two families, and only two.
 *
 *   1. SHARED RADIUS — input, button, chip, card, panel. "A surface or a
 *      control." `--radius-autara-md` (14px) is the pair rung: a button and
 *      the field beside it are ONE control group (type, then act), so they
 *      take the same corner. A pill next to a rounded rectangle reads as two
 *      unrelated objects that happen to be adjacent. Cards go one step larger
 *      (16px); chips one step tighter (8px).
 *   2. ROUNDED PARALLELOGRAM — status, and only status. That is `Badge`.
 *
 * The point of buttons giving up the pill is what it leaves behind: the only
 * fully-round things are AVATARS, INDICATOR DOTS, and the small status
 * markers Don kept deliberately. Round therefore means "a person, a state
 * light, or a status marker" and never "an action".
 *
 * That meaning is a finite resource. Every new `rounded-full` spends it, so
 * this test makes spending it a deliberate act with a name attached rather
 * than a default reach.
 *
 * A source scan, in the shape of `default-variant.test.ts`, and for the same
 * reason: jsdom has no stylesheet, so a render assertion would pass while the
 * real app was wrong.

 *
 * `Toast.tsx` came off this list under AUTM-1221. It was held for Don because
 * the Torph ink capsule is documented in the `autara-aesthetic` skill as
 * "Always rounded-full. Never rounded-xl for a capsule", and a floating status
 * capsule is arguably a status marker and arguably a surface. Don settled it
 * in the 2026-09-09 customer-web hardening plan, which puts the capsule on the
 * radius ladder; the skill's line is the one that is now stale.

 * `Dialog.tsx`, `EmptyState.tsx` and `Stepper.tsx` also came off under
