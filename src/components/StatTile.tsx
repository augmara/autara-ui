/**
 * StatTile — a single stat. THE stat treatment; `StatsStrip` is just this
 * tile in a grid.
 *
 * AUTM-726 — this began life as a private `TodayKpi` inside merchant-mobile's
 * TodayScreen. It was a large part of why Today read as designed while every
 * other screen — all of which reached for the plainer `StatsStrip` — read as
 * defaulted. Same design system, two treatments, and the better one was the
 * one that happened to be hand-made. Graduating it here means there is one
 * tile, and `StatsStrip` composes it rather than duplicating it.
 *
 * The device: a quiet sentence-case label, then the number doing the
 * shouting, then a caption that says what the number is worth NEXT TO
 * SOMETHING.
 *
 * ── AUTM-1161: the tick and the uppercase are gone ───────────────────────
 *
 * This file used to argue that the 3px accent tick was "the only place the
 * accent palette is spent, which is what keeps it reading as meaning rather
 * than decoration". `project_ui_direction_2026_09_01.md` says the exact
 * opposite about the exact same device, under rule 5:
 *
 *   "Before this, aqua and lime existed only as 3px dashes above KPI labels
 *    — two of three brand colours were decoration, which is why the product
 *    read as 'a purple app' rather than as Autara."
 *
 * Both cannot be true, and the record contradicting itself is why this
 * survived three passes of polish. Don settled it on 2026-09-07 by choosing
 * concept E off the stat-tile sheet: the tick goes.
 *
 * The direction doc wins on the merits too. A 3px dash cannot carry a
 * meaning nobody has been taught — no merchant learns "aqua means in
 * flight" from a hairline above a label — so it was decoration defended as
 * semantics. Where the accent now earns its place is the caption's delta,
 * where the colour restates something the words already say.
 *
 * The uppercase went with it. Letterspaced uppercase micro-labels are a
 * machine-written tell Don has rejected by name, and here they also forced
 * "TODAY'S REVENUE" and "PENDING PAYOUTS" onto two ragged lines, which is
 * what pushed the day's agenda down the screen.
 *
 * `tone` is kept in the props and deliberately unused (`_tone`): every
 * consumer passing it keeps compiling, the call sites still document what a
 * tile means, and the hook is there if the accent is ever spent here again.
 * Deleting it would be a breaking change that buys nothing.

     * Fill the tile with the brand accent. AUTM-713 — "one hero per screen":
     * a strip of identical white cards gives four numbers equal weight when
     * only one of them answers the question the merchant came with.
     *
     * Measured on merchant-mobile before this existed: Today spends 2.8% of
     * its pixels on brand purple and Customers 0.4%, and the whole difference
     * is Today's one solid quick-action tile. Everything else is white cards
     * on the canvas, which is why light mode read as "fully white". The tick
     * cannot carry that on its own — it is 3px.
     *
     * Use it on AT MOST ONE tile per surface. Two heroes is no hero, and the
     * emphasis stops meaning "start here".
     *
     * And only when the value is worth the emphasis — pass an expression,
     * not a bare `true`. A hero is an answer, so a tile with nothing to say
     * should not wear one: Invoices showing a full-bleed purple **$0
     * outstanding** was the first thing this variant produced, and it drew
     * the eye to the one number that was not news (the $343 collected was).
     * Zero owed, zero pending, no reviews yet — those are calm states, and a
     * screen with no hero is the correct rendering of a calm state.
     *
     * Do NOT make the fill migrate to whichever tile happens to be non-empty.
     * Emphasis that moves between surfaces teaches nothing; it just makes the
     * layout unstable. Hero that tile, or hero nothing.
     *
     * The tone tick is deliberately dropped when hero — the fill already
     * spends the accent, and a lime tick on a purple field reads as a bug.
     * Semantics are preserved by which tile you promote, not by its tick.
     *
     * Consequence, and it is intentional: without the tick the hero's label
     * starts at the padding edge, ~27px left of its ticked neighbours', so a
     * mixed strip's labels do not share a left edge. That is the very
     * misalignment `tone` defaults to `brand` to avoid (see above) — the
     * exception holds because the fill gives the hero its own frame, and
     * inside that frame the label lines up with its own value instead. Don't
     * "fix" it by re-adding an invisible tick.
