/**
 * AUTM-1018 — guards for the four defects this banner carried, plus the a11y
 * items found sweeping it.
 *
 * Every assertion here was checked by REVERTING the behaviour it guards and
 * confirming the test goes red. A guard that passes against the broken
 * component is worse than no guard, because it makes the next person
 * confident. Which revert breaks which block is recorded on each one.
 *
 * TWO THINGS THIS ENVIRONMENT CANNOT DO, stated so nobody reads more into the
 * file than is there:
 *
 *   1. jsdom has no layout engine. `getBoundingClientRect` returns zeroes and
 *      every `offsetHeight` is 0, so a test that claims to MEASURE anything
 *      here would pass against any implementation. The class and attribute
 *      assertions below are the contract; `offsetHeight` is stubbed to a real
 *      measured number so the reservation assertions are about the value the
 *      component publishes, not about a truthy string. Real geometry — tap
 *      target sizes, the 200% text-scale reflow, whether the banner actually
 *      paints over a dialog — belongs in a consumer's Playwright suite, which
 *      has a browser.
 *
 *   2. jsdom has no stylesheet, so a computed `z-index` would be empty
 *      regardless. The Tailwind class IS the contract for the layer.
