 * DurationPicker — how long a job takes.
 *
 * ── The field is a button ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Don, 2026-10-02, on the version with a typable field and a clock beside
 * it: the same value read twice ("2hrs 23min" typed, "2 hr 23 min" echoed).
 * So the field is one button that says the length in words, "2 hr 30 min",
 * or "Choose a length", and opens the sheet on a tap, Enter or Space. There
 * is no typing in the field and nothing beside it.
 *
 * It is still a labelled form control: a caller's `<label htmlFor={id}>`
 * names it and focuses it, its accessible name carries the value
 * ("Duration, 2 hr 30 min"), `invalid` sets `aria-invalid`, and a caller's
 * `aria-describedby` (the form's error) lands on it. With `name`, a hidden
 * input submits the minutes with a native form.
 *
 * ── The sheet ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Tap-ready: the result in words at the top (announced, spoken in full),
 * the common lengths one tap each (they commit), then hours and minutes side
 * by side, both visible, as two labelled radio groups with arrow keys.
 * Done commits a column choice; Cancel, the scrim and Escape keep the value.
 *
 * "Type a length" swaps the columns for one text field that reads minutes or
 * words (90, 1h 30, 1.5 hours, 1:30), shows its reading live, and commits
 * with Done. That is where the minutes between the steps come from (2 hr 23
 * min). A length that is not a whole number of minutes, zero, or past the
 * cap is refused there, in words, with Done held, so the sheet never hands
 * the form a value it cannot save.
 *
 * Rejected on purpose: drilling from an hour into its minutes (the first
 * version: the minutes were hidden and it read as "hours only"), and wheels
 * (timespent, Wanderlog on Mobbin: a drag with no keyboard model and no 200%
 * text story).
 *
 * A stored value that is not on the steps (50 min, or 4320 from before the
 * cap) reads correctly on the field ("50 min", "3 days"), opens with nothing
 * chosen and a line saying so, and is kept unless the merchant picks again.
 *
 * ── Working days (AUTM-1575) ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A ceramic coating or a paint correction keeps the car for two or three
 * days, and no number of hours says that. With `workingDays`, an "Hours |
 * Working days" switch sits ABOVE the field, as the approved v39 frame draws
 * it (not in the sheet's header, where this note used to plan it: a switch
 * inside the sheet would hide which unit the service is in until the sheet
 * was opened). Working days swaps the field for a stepper, "− 3 working days
 * +", bounded at 2 and 10. Pick-up is worked out by the server from the
 * merchant's hours, so the stepper counts days and nothing else.
 *
 * The two values stay separate on purpose: `value` is still minutes and
 * `workingDays.value` is days, so switching back to hours finds the minutes
 * where they were, and a consumer never has to encode days as minutes.
 *
 * Prior art (Mobbin, AUTM-1575): Tripadvisor's "Dates | Trip length" switch
 * over a count stepper is the steal: the same quantity said two ways, chosen
 * by a switch, with the count as a stepper rather than a typed number.
