/**
 * FormField — label + control + description + error, wired together.
 *
 * AUTM-935: it used to render those four as unconnected siblings, which
 * meant the wrapper every Autara form goes through did none of the four
 * things a form wrapper exists to do. A screen-reader user submitted the
 * form, the error appeared on screen, and nothing was announced; focusing
 * the field read the label alone, so they heard what the field was but
 * never what was wrong with it.
 *
 * It now:
 *   - generates a stable id (`useId`) when `htmlFor` is not supplied, so
 *     the label always points at something,
 *   - marks the control `aria-invalid` while `error` is set, which is
 *     also what fires the red `.field-input` treatment,
 *   - links description and error through `aria-describedby`,
 *   - announces the error via `role="alert"`,
 *   - gives `required` an accessible name instead of a bare red asterisk.
 *
 * Precedence is **caller wins**, deliberately. `id` and `aria-invalid`
 * are only filled in when absent, and `aria-describedby` is MERGED rather
 * than replaced — merchant-mobile's MeScreen points describedby at a
 * CharCount, and clobbering that would trade one announcement for another.
 *
 * Only the first element child is wired (that is the control; anything
 * after it is adornment like a CharCount). Pass `wireControl={false}` to
 * opt out entirely and get the pre-AUTM-935 behaviour.
