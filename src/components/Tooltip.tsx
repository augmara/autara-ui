/**
 * Tooltip — Radix tooltip primitive in the Autara Torph ink aesthetic.
 *
 * - `#0E0A1A` ink background, white text, hairline `white/10` ring.
 *   Matches the Toast capsule grammar so floating UI reads as one
 *   family.
 * - **No drop shadow** — the dark/light contrast against the cream
 *   canvas does the depth work (Autara house rule).
 * - AUTM-967: it did NOT keep "the existing Radix slide-in / zoom-in
 *   animations", which is what this line used to claim. Those were
 *   `tailwindcss-animate` utilities and the plugin is not a dependency of
 *   this package or of any consumer, so a tooltip snapped into existence.
 *   That is the most repeated micro-interaction in the product and the one
 *   where an instant appearance reads most like a glitch. It is now
 *   `.floating-panel` — real CSS in `utilities/animations.css`, side-aware
 *   off `data-side`, origin off Radix's own transform-origin variable,
 *   reduced motion respected.
 *
 * The `theme` prop is preserved for source-level compatibility but is
 * currently a **no-op** — only the ink variant ships. A light /
 * cream-canvas variant for inline help text on form fields is a
 * deferred follow-up.
