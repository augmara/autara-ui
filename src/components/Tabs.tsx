/**
 * Tabs — Radix tab primitive, segmented-control shape.
 *
 * ─── AUTM-1594: canvas v44 "Segmented" ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A band pill track; the tab you are on takes the SELECTED fill (#2e1070
 * with white in light, #8f6bff with ink in dark) and its label in Bold; the
 * rest are Medium at 72% ink. Selected is the same fill as the chosen
 * filter chip, so "selected" reads one way everywhere.
 *
 * The first build drew the active tab raised (white on band, 1.05:1), as v44
 * did. That was the step AUTM-974 (below) called invisible; the design
 * session changed it to the Selected fill on canvas v51 (2026-10-01).
 *
 * Drawn at the sheet's size (40px pills in a 48px track) with AUTM-622's
 * 44px floor kept as a hit area: each trigger carries a centred, unpainted
 * 44px pseudo-element, the pattern Switch uses. The track's 4px padding is
 * the room it needs.
 *
 * ─── AUTM-974: why the active tab is a solid fill now ───────────────────
 *
 * It used to be `bg-[var(--surface)]` with `ring-1 ring-inset` on a
 * `--surface-elevated` track. `--surface` is 1.05:1 from `--surface-elevated`,
 * so the fill was invisible and THE RING WAS THE TAB — a 1px outline was the
 * only thing telling the merchant which of Day / Today / Week / Month / List
 * they were looking at.
 *
 * That is rule 4 of the Autara Glass direction
 * (`knowledge/project_ui_direction_2026_09_01.md`), as Don extended it on
 * 2026-09-01 with a screenshot of exactly this: "no outline buttons or
 * sections, boxes as we discussed. everything should be solid." Emphasis is
 * carried by a SOLID fill — not a tint, not a ring, not an outlined box.
 *
 * Two things changed, and both follow from that one rule:
 *
 *   ACTIVE TRIGGER → `--act-fill` / `--on-act`. Rule 5 assigns purple to
 *   ACTS, and `tokens/glass.css` names "active nav" as one of them. The tab
 *   you are on is where you are acting. The fill is 9.5:1 from the track in
 *   light and 1.9:1 in dark, so it defines its own shape and has earned the
 *   right to drop the ring.
 *
 *   TRACK → keeps `--surface-elevated`, loses its border. A container whose
 *   fill is a whisper off the card and whose edge is a hairline is an
 *   outlined section box, which the same rule bans. The track is a ground,
 *   not an emphasis, so the ground is all it gets.
 *
 * ─── The focus ring, which a solid fill can quietly break ───────────────
 *
 * A solid accent fill under the house `ring-[var(--accent)]/35` focus ring is
 * how the merchant-mobile Today pass put purple on purple at 1.0:1 and lost a
 * keyboard user's place on the row they were most likely to be on. Two fixes,
 * both measured in `solid-emphasis.test.ts`:
 *
 *   - Full-strength `--accent`, not `/35`. At 35% over the track the ring
 *     measures ~1.9:1, under the 3:1 WCAG 2.4.11 asks of a focus indicator.
 *     At full strength it is 8.0:1 light / 3.4:1 dark against the track.
 *   - `ring-offset-[var(--surface-elevated)]`, not `--background`. The offset
 *     band is what separates the purple ring from the purple fill, so it has
 *     to be painted in the colour that is actually behind the tab. Pointing
 *     it at the page canvas drew a cream halo inside a dark track.
 *
 * Radius follows the ladder in `tokens/radii.css` rather than raw Tailwind
 * rungs: the track takes the shared control radius, the triggers take the
 * "control inside a control" rung one step tighter.
 *
 * Works in both themes off the token stack — there is no separate dark
 * companion to wait for any more.

 * asked for the motion of a dashboard he liked, where "the active pill slides
 * to the new item (one shared element moving, not a fade)".
 *
 * Drawn transform-only, so nothing animates a width: two round caps at the
 * pill's ends and a one-pixel bar between their centres scaled to the gap. A
 * scaled bar has no corners to distort and the caps never scale, so the pill
 * keeps its shape at every frame while all three move on one transition. The
 * trigger's own fill steps aside (`data-slide="ready"` on the list) once the
 * pill has measured, so a first paint, a server render and a reduced-motion
 * user all see the plain selected fill and never an empty track.
